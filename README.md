## Overview
- Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. 
- It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. 
- For example, the rule {onions, potatoes} --> {burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy burger. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.
